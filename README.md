Classic algorithms implementation in Scala:

* Quick sort
* Merge sort
* Quick select
* Strongly connected components: Kosaraju, Tarjan, Gabow
* Binary heap
* Hash set
* Minimum cut: Karger random contractions
* Single source shortest paths: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford
* Union find with path compression and union by rank
* Minimum spanning tree: Prim, Kruskal
* All-pairs shortest paths: Floyd-Warshal
* Scheduling
* Median maintenance
* Travelling salesman: Held-Karp
* Clustering: single-link
